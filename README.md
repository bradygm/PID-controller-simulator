# PID Controller Simulator
In this notebook you will explore the challenges of controlling a simple robot arm. You will write your own PID functions in Python that will move the arm with *finesse*, **precision**, and ***speed*** beyond your own abilities. We will walk you through the steps of coding and tuning your controller, as well as leave open questions for you to explore in an open-ended simulation.

If you didn't see the accompanying presentation with this Colab, you can watch it here: [**How to Control a Robot: Intuition for Feedback Control and PID**](https://youtu.be/dR0nTvZqabQ). This presentation and code is part of a workshop for RoboLaunch at Carnegie Mellon University.
